# Friends Quiz  
### COGS18 Final Project  
  
A Friends quiz for the masses ;)

In this project, you may take a quiz to test your knowledge of the television show Friends. Once completed, your score will be calculated. And for an extra bonus, you can generate a random song that Phoebe has performed.

Therefore, below are four functions. The first is to format the user's answers in case they make a typo. Following this, is a function to provide the test itself. Third, is a function that will calculate the user's score. And fourth, is a function that will output a random song of Phoebe's after shuffling through a list of options. Last but not least, there are four test functions that silently pass to ensure everything ran successfully.
